UCB Data homework final project - Fun with beer!

Group participants:
Nicki Lang
Chelan Patton
Becca Wolber

Project Goal: Classify which styles and attributes of beers are popular/highly rated in regions of the United States. Use supervised learning to train machine learning models to find the "typical" beer for a state or region. 

Other Ideas: Trend analysis of beer types over time, possibly using cluster analysis for a beer recommender based on tastes

data sources: 
Data world dataset - beer reviews from Beer Advocate 
kaggle craft cans dataset
add beer style definitions?
